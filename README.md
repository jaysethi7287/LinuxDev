# Linux Commands in C and Bash Scripting

## Overview
This project aims to recreate standard Linux commands in C to understand system programming concepts and enhance proficiency in Bash scripting. Each C file represents a different Linux command implementation, and associated Bash scripts are used to compile and test these commands.

## Project Structure

- `/Commands`: Contains source files for Linux command implementations like `cat.c`, `grep.c`, etc.
- `/Bash Scripts`: Contains scripts to compile and run C programs and automate various tasks.

### Commands

- `cat.c`: A simple implementation of the `cat` command.
- `grep.c`: (Planned) A simple implementation of the `grep` command.

### Bash Scripts

- `compileRun.sh`: Compiles C programs and executes them, handling command-line arguments.
- `helloWorld.sh`: Example script for basic Bash scripting practices.

## Getting Started

To clone this repository and run the scripts, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaysethi7287/LinuxDev/
cd LinuxDev
